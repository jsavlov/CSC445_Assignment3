Follower

##Leader Election
-All changes to the system go through the leader.
-In Raft there are two timeout settings which control elections.

##Election Timeout
-The election timeout is the amount of time a follower waits until becoming a candidate.
-The election timeout is randomized to be between 150ms and 300ms.
-After the election timeout the follower becomes a candidate and starts a new election term...votes for itself...and sends out Request Vote messages to other nodes.
-If the receiving node hasn't voted yet in this term then it votes for the candidate...and the node resets its election timeout.
-Once a candidate has a majority of votes it becomes leader.
-The leader begins sending out Append Entries messages to its followers.
-These messages are sent in intervals specified by the heartbeat timeout.
-Followers then respond to each Append Entries message.
-This election term will continue until a follower stops receiving heartbeats and becomes a candidate.
-Requiring a majority of votes guarantees that only one leader can be elected per term.
-If two nodes become candidates at the same time then a split vote can occur.
-The nodes will wait for a new election and try again.

##Log Replication
-Once we have a leader elected we need to replicate all changes to our system to all nodes.
-This is done by using the same Append Entries message that was used for heartbeats.
-Each change is added as an entry in the node's log.
-To commit the entry the node first replicates it to the follower nodes...
-then the leader waits until a majority of nodes have written the entry.
-The entry is now committed on the leader node and the node state is "5".
-The leader then notifies the followers that the entry is committed.
-The cluster has now come to consensus about the system state.

1. A change is sent to the leader from a client
2. The change is appended to the leader's log
3. The change is sent to the followers on the next heartbeat
4. An entry is commited once a majority of the followers acknowledge it
5. And a response is sent to the client
