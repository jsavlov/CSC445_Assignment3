##SEVERS
-Receive state machine operations from clients
-Log and replicate the operations as necessary
-Apply them to a state machine on each server

##OPERATIONS
-Copycat replicated state machines are modified and queried by defining OPERATIONS through which a client and state machine 
can communicate.
-OPERATIONS are replicated by the Copycat cluster and are translated into arguments to methods on the replicated state machine.
-Users must define the interface between the client and the cluster by implementing OPERATION classes that clients will submit 
to the replicated state machine.

#COMMANDS 
-COMMANDS are state machine OPERATIONS that alter the system’s state. 
-For example, in a map state machine some COMMANDS might include PUT and REMOVE. 
-To implement a state machine COMMAND, simply implement the COMMAND interface. 
-The generic argument to the COMMAND interface indicates the return type of the COMMAND.

#QUERIES
-QUERIES are state machine OPERATIONS that read the system’s state but do not modify it.
-For example, in a map state machine some QUERIES might include GET, SIZE, and ISEMPTY. 
-To implement a state machine QUERY, implement the QUERY interface. 
-The generic argument to the QUERY interface indicates the return type of the QUERY.

#IMPLEMENTATION OF OPERATIONS
-State machine OPERATIONS are implemented as public methods on the state machine class. 
-Commands are defined by implementing the COMMAND interface. COMMAND takes a single generic argument that defines the 
output (return value) of the command implementation.
-They accept a single Commit parameter where the generic argument for the commit is the OPERATION accepted by the method. 
-Copycat automatically detects the COMMAND or QUERY that applies to a given state machine methods based on the generic 
argument to the Commit parameter.
